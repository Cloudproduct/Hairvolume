    <span>Hey, did you know that you’ve been lied to about the real reason why
        you’ve been losing your hair?I know it sounds crazy because we’re so used
        to hearing about the usual things like genetics, diet, and lifestyle and
        while all of that is important guys, it is missing…
        <p>THE REAL BIG REASON</p>
        why most men today are going bald even before they hit 35.If you are
        experiencing any form of hair loss, I’m going to share three secrets with
        you today that’s going to revolutionize the way you think about your hair
        and give you a solution that will have you growing back your
        <p>hair FASTER than anything</p>
        you’ve tried in the past.But before we get to that, who am I?Well, my name
        is Ronald Nzimora and I am an avid hair loss researcher. 6 years ago after
        I clocked 36, I began to notice my hairline was receding backwards.At
        first, I chalked it up to the fact that I had recently had a surgery and
        probably lost some nutrients, but when it continued, I then started
        wondering if my genes. My grand Dad had been bald and I had read
        somewhere, just like you’ve probably done that hair loss could be
        attributed to genetics.
    </span><br />
    <img src="hair loss.jpeg" alt="" />
    <br />
    <span>genetics or not, I was DESPERATE not to lose my hair, as I guess you are
        too. Look, I am somewhat good-looking but I know I won’t win a contest for
        the most handsome man in Nigeria and I was terrified that losing my hair
        would make me look uglier, meaning I might begin to lose opportunities in
        the work and relationship parts of my life, because no matter how much we
        try to deny it.I also didn’t want to be condemned to wearing a cap like
        Banky W to hide my baldness. I hate caps!That was what turned me into an
        avid researcher of hair loss issues. Over the next few months and years, I
        read hundreds of hair journals, online article, watched countless of
        videos on TV and online, andemailed tens of Doctors, most of who treated
        several Hollywood celebrities.And my quest uncovered THE ANSWER, something
        that if you are currently losing your hair will make you jump for joy! So
        what is amazing hair loss ANSWER I found?</span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It’s the FACT that the REASON why you’re losing your hair has nothing to
            do with your genes.
        </li>
        <li>It also has nothing to do with your lifestyle.</li>
    </ul>
    <span>
        It’s more about this.What you are looking at is a by-product enzyme inside
        your body and it’s reaction with other things that go on in there is the
        biggest singular reason that’s causing your hair follicles to weaken, die
        and fall off, leading you to become progressively bald.And today I’m going
        to share with you 3 secrets about THE ANSWER, this hair loss discovery and
        how you can use it to progressively regrow your hair, if you’ve lost it.
        Or stop it’s depletion if you are currently losing it. Now I know what
        you’re probably thinking: I have heard something like this before and it
        was a waste of time. I assure you…This Is Different!It’s something quite
        unlike what you’ve seen or heard before that will show you how to finally
        and forever, say bye-bye to hair loss problems in your life as you marvel
        at the amazing results you’re seeing.Ready?So the first secret is…
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Hair Creams, Hair Lotions, and Poultice Do not Recover Hair for Men
            (aka, they do not work)

        The hair loss treatment Manufacturing industry is a $3.9 billion industry.
        And their goal is not to make your hair grow back and not fall off again.I
        mean think about it. If they make your hair grow back and STAY ON
        PERMANENTLY, how then will they make any more money selling their product?
        What they specialize in is giving you “hope” that your hair can grow back
        if you use their products.This is important to note because this is the
        only way they can sell you more and more products.And even if you give up
        on one hair lotion, serum or cream and switch to a different brand?They
        still make money because you see what you do not know is that most of the
        hair treatment products you see out there are manufactured.5 companies,
        Procter & Gamble, Unilever PLC, L’Oréal SA, Taisho Pharmaceutical, and
        Pierre Fabre control the production and sales of over 80% of the hair
        treatment solutions you will find in the market or pharmacies. You may see
        them on the shelves with different names, but be rest assured 2-3 out of
        every 5 are coming from one company.What more?Research has shown that most
        of these products, contain harmful chemicals like, formaldehyde, which is
        used to embalm dead people in mortuaries, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)
        which causes skin aging, and parabens, which… wait for it… causes hair
        loss!Imagine that!Imagine buying a product to put on your scalp in order
        to stop your hair loss, but the chemicals inside it is used on corpses,
        ages your skin making you look older than you really are over time, and
        actually even makes you lose your hair even faster!Is that something you
        should be putting on your body? I think not.The second secret is…
        Follicular Unit
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>Follicular Unit Transplantation works but it is EXPENSIVE</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="cut.jpeg" alt="" />
    <span>
        This is a surgical procedure in which a plastic or dermatological surgeon
        moves hair to a bald area of the head from an area that still has some.And
        it works.It’s popular among the rich and famous, entertainment celebrities
        and sport stars. It’s exactly what Wayne Rooney did when he was going bald
        at the age of 25.But the thing is, it’s EXPENSIVE. In Nigeria, you will
        have to pay between $3,000 – $4,000 which is equivalent to 2.5 million to
        3.5 million Naira for the procedure. And that is if you can find a plastic
        surgeon who can do it. This is important because most people advertising
        the procedure here are quacks. That is why people who can afford it fly to
        London or Dubai to get it done.The third secret is…
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>DHT (DiHydroTestosterone)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is DHT you ask?</h2>
    <span>
        DHT is a sex hormone that is a modified version of testosterone and… It is
        the singular BIGGEST REASON for male pattern hair loss.Here’s why knowing
        this is important.When your body produces far more testosterone than it
        can handle, it converts the excess to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and excess
        amounts of this dihydrotestosterone affects the hair follicles. DHT
        interferes with the hair’s growth cycle, shrinking and shortening the hair
        making it easier for it to fall out and more difficult for it to grow
        back.Now, I know what you’re thinking.You’re saying, “why doesn’t the body
        just secrete it out?”, right?It does but only if you make certain
        lifestyle changes like regular exercise, eating a steady diet of white
        mushroom, kale, tomatoes, watermelons, carrots, and mangoes. Also foods
        like berries, liver, and oily fish.Even then it’s slow, plus the body
        still needs DHT anyway because it is responsible for keeping your prostate
        healthy, muscle growth, and voice.What you want is a way for your body to
        stop turning testosterone to DHT and having it in excess.In the course of
        my research I found the answer and that answer is…DHT BlockingThis is
        where you use natural herbs to block your body from turning normal
        testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, so your hair follicles can begin to
        grow and regenerate again.And the one solution I discovered that makes
        that happen is you can take this food supplement I found called Hair
        Voluum which will make your hair come back to life again.
    </span>

    <span>
        What makes Hair Voluum so special?It’s a combination of 7 different herbs
        and natural minerals sourced from nature which stop excess production of
        DHT, rebuild your hair follicles and stop the growth and spread of
        bacteria on your head. Here Are The

        Pygeum Bark – Pygeum is an herbal extract taken from the bark of the
        African cherry tree. The tree is also known as the African plum tree. For
        centuries, it has been used in ancient African medicine to treat hair
        loss. It does so by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to
        dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the main cause of male pattern baldness and
        female pattern baldness
    </span>

        Fo-ti – (Polygonum multiflorum) is the root of a climbing plant native to
        east Asia. It’s one of the most popular herbs used in traditional Chinese
        medicine. It is very effective as a treatment to stimulate hair growth,
        both by inducing the anagen (or growth phase) in resting hair follicles
        and by encouraging cells at the root of the hair to multiply faster.It
        also helps to reverse or prevent gray hair and bring back color.

    <img src="Pumpkin Seed.jpeg" alt="">
    <span>
        Pumpkin Seed – is rich in many nutrients that benefit scalp and hair health, including Phosphorus, Zinc,
        Magnesium, Iron, Vitamins E, A, riboflavin, thiamin, niacin and precious essential fatty acids (EFAs).


        Pumpkin seed extract has a protective effect against nutrient deficiency-driven hair loss.

    <span>
        Horsetail – It’s a plant that strengthens and improves the elasticity of the hair fiber, helps regulate the hair
        growth cycle,

        and reduces inflammation and improves cell turnover to create an optimal environment on the scalp for healthy
        hair growth.


        Saw Palmetto – Known as “Ope Aginju” by the Yorubas. An extract of saw palmetto berries helps block
        5-alpha-reductase, an enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT.

    <span>
        Nettle leaf – is a nutritious plant popular in Western herbal medicine. It’s a rich source of antioxidants,
        which are needed for reducing the number of free radicals in your system.


        Green Tea Extract – supports healthy hair growth and regrowth, preventing hair loss and improving hair health.
    </span>
    <img src="Grass-5.jpeg" alt="">
    <span>
        In a study, researchers found that topical green tea-derived EGCG extract stimulated hair follicles and
        preventing damage to skin and hair cells.

        Together these 7 herbs were fused together into one potent supplement. And no, it’s not all those hard to
        swallow pills, or capsules or tablets!

        What it is really, is…
    </span>
    <img src="Medicine.jpeg" alt="">
    <span>
        A Gummy!This means you can chew it just like gum and immediately have the herbs enter your digestive system and
        bloodstream to begin it’s work. And it has a great taste too. Just pop 2 into your mouth daily and give it time
        to work its magic. Once you start taking Hair Voluum, you will begin to see an almost immediate change in your
        hair. Your hair will begin to grow again.over a short time become thicker, and fuller like it used to be when
        you were young growing up. And I, as your guide who has previously used Hair Voluum to replace my lost hair,
        what I do is be available to show you how to make that process, easy, faster and even more importantly, very
        cost effective for you.

        So what I’ve done is I’ve negotiated with the importers of Hair Voluum and they have created a special page
        online where you can go and order a bottle or two at a discounted price.

        If you click the link below this video, you can get your own supply of Hair Voluum right now at a 40% price
        reduction.But this is only for a very limited window of time.

        I honestly don’t know how much longer the importers will keep this discounted price up.

        You know how importers are. They are the only people who import Hair Voluum and as their stock, they will likely
        shoot the prices up
